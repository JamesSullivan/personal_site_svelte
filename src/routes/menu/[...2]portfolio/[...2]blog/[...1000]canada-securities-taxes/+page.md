It is crucial to acknowledge that each individual's tax circumstances are distinct. The information provided below is a short, general, and incomplete summary. You should seek guidance from a tax professional to find the best approach for your situation.

## TFSAs, RRSPs, and RRIFs

<p>A <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4466/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa-guide-individuals.html">tax-free savings account (TFSA)</a> is a way for individuals who are 18 or older and who have a valid social insurance number (SIN) to save money tax-free throughout their lifetime. It lets you contribute up to a certain amount annually (the annual TFSA limit for 2024 is $7,000). Income growth in the account is tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free, but unlike RRSPs, contributions are not tax-deductible. There are Self-directed TFSAs and financial institution-managed TFSAs. However, you must open the TFSA at a qualified financial institution, credit union, or insurance company. Penalties for excess contributions or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4466/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa-guide-individuals.html#p44_1129">prohibited or non-qualified investments</a>, especially for non-residents, are severe, so care is needed.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp.html">Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)</a> is a tax-deferred saving and investment vehicle for retirement. Deductible RRSP contributions can reduce your tax to a certain amount. RRSPs also have advantages for dividends from U.S. stocks. Any income you earn in the RRSP is usually exempt from tax as long as the funds remain in the plan. When you turn 71, you must convert your RRSP to an RRIF, as failure will cause you to be taxed on the entire amount.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-retirement-income-fund-rrif.html">Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)</a> is an instrument for paying out funds that have been compounding without tax in an RRSP until now. The money is tax-sheltered while in the RRIF fund but is taxed as it is withdrawn. An RRSP must be converted into an RRIF by the end of the year that the holder turns 71. As an RRIF is a fund disbursement instrument, the holder of an RRIF cannot add money to it. The fund must pay out a certain amount in the year following the year the RRIF is entered into and all subsequent years.</p>

<p>In summary, the difference between an RRSP and an RRIF is that an RRSP is an instrument to encourage retirement savings by providing tax reductions. Contrastingly, even though an RRIF is also a tax-sheltered account, its primary purpose is to provide income in retirement according to a fixed schedule.</p>

 
### Finding out your TFSA contribution and RRSP deduction limit

<p>Your TFSA contribution room is the maximum amount you can contribute to your TFSA and can be found at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4466/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa-guide-individuals.html#P44_1115">TFSA annual limit amount</a>. However, given the extremely severe penalties for over-contribution, it is best to confirm <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4466/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa-guide-individuals.html#P44_1120">your allowed contribution amounts directly from the CRA</a>.</p>

<p>Your RRSP deduction limit is indicated on your latest notice of Assessment or Reassessment after your tax return (T1028) is processed. The annual contribution amount is 18% of your earned income, up to annual limits ($31,560 in 2024). Again, there are penalties for over-contribution, so it is best to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/contributing-a-rrsp-prpp/where-you-find-your-rrsp-prpp-deduction-limit.html">confirm the actual amount directly with the CRA</a>.</p>


## Capital gains and losses on stocks, bonds, etc

<p>A <em>capital gain</em> is an increase in the value of a stock (or other investment or asset) from the original purchase price. When the price of your stock increases, compared to the purchase price, you have a taxable capital gain. Capital gains start "unrealized" but become "realized" and taxable when you sell the stock.</p>

<p>Similarly, there is a <em>capital loss</em> when your stock decreases in value. Realized capital losses can offset capital gains, reducing tax obligations. If you only have capital losses, you can use a capital loss to offset a capital gain anytime in the future or even for capital gains declared in the previous three years, underlining the importance of good record keeping.</p>

<h3>Capital gains tax rate in Canada</h3>

<p>In Canada, 50% of the value of any capital gains is taxable. When you realize a capital gain in Canada, you add 50% to your yearly income. The exact impact will depend on your marginal tax rate based on income, province of residence, and other factors.</p>

<p>Adjusted cost base (ACB) = book value (the original purchase price of the investment) plus costs to purchase it, such as transaction costs. If you buy shares at more than one price, you need to use the average volume-weighted price for the adjusted cost base when selling them.</p>

<h3>Prohibition against superficial losses to offset capital gains</h3>

<p>The CRA permits offsetting capital gains with losses but frowns upon unwinding a stock position only to repurchase it soon afterward. If the CRA decides that a realization of loss was short-term and for tax purposes only, it can deem it a "superficial loss," you will be unable to use it to offset the capital gains.</p>


## Interest

<p>Interest earned on  bonds, T-bills, GICs and other instruments is taxable at the same marginal tax rate as ordinary income.</p>


## Canadian Dividend Income

<p>Payments made by Canadian public corporations to their shareholders get preferential tax treatment for either eligible or non-eligible dividend tax credits</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5.html">T5 statement of investment income</a> notes whether your dividend is eligible or other than eligible.  Some other statements that may include dividend income are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>T4PS statement of employee profit-sharing plan allocations and payments</li>
        <li>T3 statement of trust income allocations and designations</li>
        <li>T5013 statement of partnership income</li>
    </ul>


### Eligible vs. other than eligible dividends

<p>Eligible dividends come from a corporation’s income already taxed at the general corporate tax rate. The dividend increases your taxable income, but the subsequent tax credit will offset that. Non-eligible dividends, referred to as “ordinary” dividends, come from income taxed at a lower small-business tax rate and benefit from a slightly lower dividend tax credit.</p>

<p>The tax rate for dividends from Canadian stocks includes a “<a href="https://ca.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/5-501-8610?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true">gross-up</a>.” You must add dividends to your income at a rate slightly higher than what was received and then pay with after-tax dollars. Eligible dividends are grossed up by 38%, and other than eligible dividends by 15%. Add your grossed-up dividend to your other sources of personal income to get your total income, which you can then use to find your marginal tax rate.</p>


## Foreign Stocks

<a href="https://www.taxtips.ca/personaltax/investing/taxtreatment/shares-of-corporations.htm">Tax Treatment of Income From Investments in Shares of Corporations</a>

<p>When you hold a foreign stock that pays dividends, a withholding tax should be deducted from the foreign dividends when they are paid. Even though you can recover part of this by claiming a foreign tax credit at tax time, this is a bit of a hassle as you file your tax return and have to figure out where these credits are supposed to go. You should also be aware of the fact that any dividend income you receive from a foreign corporation does not qualify for a dividend tax credit in the way that it does for qualified Canadian shares. What this means for you when you file your Canadian tax return is that you have to pay tax on 100 percent of the dividend before deducting withholding tax.</p>

<p>Moreover, even in a scenario where when distributions that stem from U.S. company shares are categorized as capital gains or a return of capital for U.S. taxpayers, they will still be considered 100-percent taxable dividends for you as a Canadian taxpayer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you hold shares of a foreign corporation in a registered plan like an RRSP or an RRIF, there is typically no withholding tax. But there is a problem when it comes to a TFSA. If your foreign shares reside in a TFSA, withholding tax is still deducted, but in this case typically can't be recovered at tax return time through a tax credit or other recovery avenue.</p>

<p>When it comes to trading foreign securities, the issue of foreign exchange also comes into play. If you receive any foreign dividends, then that income must be converted into Canadian dollars. That converted amount is what you are required to include in your taxable income. The conversion rate that you use is technically the one that falls on the date when your foreign dividend income was received. However, to keep things simple you can use the average annual exchange rate that is published by the Bank of Canada for your entire basket of dividends that you received in a year. All you need to do is to use your favourite search tool to search out the terms average Canadian/U.S. exchange rate for taxes in 2023 or whatever year you require.</p>

<p>In terms of the adjusted cost base of any foreign shares that you may have bought, the ACB must be calculated in Canadian dollars using the Bank of Canada conversion rate for a given year. If you transferred Canadian funds to make the purchase, you need to use the exchange rate you incurred in the transfer. If you used foreign currency to buy or sell shares, you are allowed to use the exchange rate on the settlement date in order to convert the</p>
