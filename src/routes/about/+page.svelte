<h1 class="l-font-size">About</h1><br>
<p>I have always enjoyed working with others to develop applications with new technologies, specifically using my 15+ years of experience in software engineering/product development to create enhanced data and analytics information products. I am currently working on web scraping data to apply recent advances in NLP and LLMs for a financial information product.</p>
<br>
<p>All software development involves trade-offs, requirements are constantly changing, and product management involves hard decisions around force ranking priorities.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I am interested in collaborating on exciting projects, both open-source and commercial. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:james.sullivan@solutions.asia">james.sullivan@solutions.asia</a>.</p>
